## List of Gulp tasks

To run separate task type in command line `gulp [task_name]`.
Almost all tasks also have watch mode - `gulp [task_name]:watch`, but you don't need to use it directly.

### Main tasks
Task name          | Description                                                      
:------------------|:----------------------------------
`default`          | will start all tasks required by project in dev mode: initial build, watch files, run server with livereload
`build:dev`        | build dev version of project (without code optimizations)
`build`            | build production-ready project (with code optimizations)

##Other
You can also use [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts):

* `npm run start` - same as `gulp default`.
* `npm run build` - same as `gulp build --production`, output goes to `./build`.
* `npm run lint` - linting javascript with **eslint**.
* `npm run lint-fix` - fix as many issues as possible relatives to **eslint** settings.

## Deploy

The site is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as a static site, settings are in `vercel.json`
(build command `npm run build`, output directory `build`, clean URLs without `.html`).

To preview the production build locally:

* `npm run build && npx serve build`
